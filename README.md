## Aim:
To design an AI-powered healthcare assistant chatbot that supports users in:

Symptom checking

Appointment scheduling

Health FAQs

The chatbot should respond efficiently using Straightforward Prompting, Tabular Format Prompting, and Preceding Question Prompting techniques.

## Tools Required:
1.AI text generation platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)

2.Word/Excel for prompt and response documentation

3.Internet access for AI model testing (if needed)

## Theory:
Prompt engineering tailors inputs to guide AI models for accurate and user-centric responses. The three prompting methods used are:

Straightforward Prompting:
                   Direct command or question to extract a concise response.

Tabular Format Prompting:
                  Organizing complex or multi-point information into tables for clarity.

Preceding Question Prompting:
                  Creating a back-and-forth conversational flow to solve layered user issues.

## Experiment Procedure:
We simulated 3 core healthcare service scenarios:

1.Symptom Checker

2.Appointment Scheduling

3.Health FAQs

Each scenario was tested using all three prompting techniques.

## Scenarios and Prompts

## Scenario 1: Symptom Checker

# Prompt	                                                             Prompting Type	                  Bot Response
1."I have a sore throat and fever."	                                  Straightforward Prompt	         "These symptoms could indicate a viral infection such as flu. Please consider seeing a doctor if it persists."

2."Show possible causes of sore throat and fever with                 Tabular Format Prompt           	Table with columns: Symptom, Possible Cause, Remedy, Urgency Level
suggested remedies in a table."	

"I feel feverish." ➔ "Do you have other symptoms?" ➔                Preceding Question Prompt	       Progressive, engaging diagnosis flow
"Yes, sore throat and chills." ➔ "You might have a cold or flu.
Do you want to find a clinic nearby?"	

# Scenario 2: Appointment Scheduling

# Prompt	                                                             Prompting Type	                   Bot Response
1."Book an appointment with a dentist tomorrow morning."	             Straightforward Prompt	           "Your appointment with a dentist is scheduled for 10 AM tomorrow."

2."List available time slots for Dr. Mehta on Friday in a table."	    Tabular Format Prompt	             Table showing Time Slots, Availability, Location

3."I need a cardiologist." ➔ "Preferred time?" ➔ "Evening today."    Preceding Question Prompt	        Dynamic scheduling interaction
➔ "Dr. Rao is available at 6:30 PM. Shall I book it?"	

# Scenario 3: Health FAQs
## Prompt	                                                               Prompting Type	                   Bot Response
1."What is the normal blood pressure range?"                            	Straightforward Prompt	           "Normal blood pressure is usually around 120/80 mmHg."

2."List common health parameters and their normal ranges in a table."	   Tabular Format Prompt	             Table with columns: Parameter, Normal Range, Measurement Frequency

3."Is 140/90 high?" ➔ "Yes, it may indicate stage 1 hypertension."      Preceding Question Prompt	         Helpful follow-up guidance
➔ "What should I do?"	

# Analysis
# Prompting Type           	Best Used For	                               Strengths	                         Weaknesses
Straightforward	            Quick                                        factual health tips	Speedy         informative	May miss nuance
Tabular Format	             Health stats                                 comparisons	Very clear             easy to scan	Not interactive
Preceding Question	         Symptom triage                               appointment booking	Natural        patient-like interaction	Slower, complex flow

# Evaluation and Observations
1.Straightforward Prompting gave rapid answers suitable for FAQ-style questions.

2.Tabular Prompting worked best for structured medical data like normal ranges or time slots.

3.Preceding Question Prompting gave a personalized, context-aware experience for health concerns.

# Conclusion:
The AI-powered healthcare chatbot successfully used three prompting methods to handle health inquiries, symptoms, and appointment needs. Prompting variation improves flexibility and user satisfaction.

# Result:
Prompts were successfully implemented in a healthcare assistant context, demonstrating the chatbot’s capability to assist users with health-related needs using effective prompt engineering.
